   - Fill out the advisory form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to: security@terragon.dev
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available upon request)

3. **Private Disclosure**
   - Contact maintainers directly for critical vulnerabilities
   - Use secure communication channels when possible

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Quantum Scheduler Security

As a quantum-inspired task scheduling system, our software has unique security considerations:

#### Task Scheduling Security
- **Malicious Tasks**: All task inputs are validated through our QuantumValidator system
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Built-in limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- **Dependency Injection**: Task dependencies are validated for correctness and security
- **Input Sanitization**: Task IDs and metadata are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

#### Optimization Engine Security
- **Quantum State Manipulation**: Superposition states are protected from external interference
- **Annealing Process**: Temperature and iteration limits prevent infinite loops
- **Population Diversity**: Controls prevent exploitation of convergence algorithms
- **Cache Poisoning**: Cached results are cryptographically verified

#### Performance Monitoring Security
- **Metrics Collection**: Only authorized metrics are collected and stored
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive scheduling data is anonymized in logs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail of all security-relevant operations
- **Alert System**: Real-time detection of anomalous scheduling patterns

### Input Validation

The compiler validates all inputs to prevent:

- **Buffer Overflows**: Bounds checking on all array operations
- **Integer Overflows**: Safe arithmetic operations throughout
- **Format String Attacks**: Parameterized logging and error messages
- **Path Traversal**: Sanitized file path handling

### Memory Safety

- **RAII**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization throughout C++ codebase
- **Smart Pointers**: Automatic memory management where possible
- **Bounds Checking**: Array bounds validation in debug builds
- **Sanitizers**: Regular testing with AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer

### Cryptographic Considerations

While photon-mlir-bridge is not primarily a cryptographic tool:

- **Secure Communications**: HTTPS for all network communications
- **Credential Storage**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure randomness where needed

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Compilation Security

```cpp
// Use trusted model sources
auto model = photon::loadModel("verified_model.onnx");

// Validate model before compilation
if (!photon::validateModel(model)) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Model validation failed");
}

// Use safe compilation options
photon::CompilerConfig config{
    .enable_security_checks = true,
    .validate_outputs = true,
    .sandbox_mode = true
};
```

### Hardware Security

```cpp
// Verify hardware authentication
auto device = photon::Device::connect("lightmatter://device");
if (!device.authenticate()) {
    throw std::runtime_error("Hardware authentication failed");
}

// Use secure communication channels
device.enableTLS(true);
device.setCredentials(cert, key);
```

### Python Security

```python
import photon_mlir as pm

# Validate input models
model = torch.load("model.pth", weights_only=True)  # Safer loading

# Use secure compilation options
compiled = pm.compile(
    model,
    target="lightmatter_envise",
    security_mode="strict",
    validate_inputs=True
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Practices

### Static Analysis

We use multiple static analysis tools:

- **CodeQL**: GitHub's semantic code analysis
- **Clang Static Analyzer**: C++ static analysis
- **cppcheck**: Additional C++ checks
- **Bandit**: Python security analysis
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning

### Dynamic Analysis

Runtime security testing includes:

- **AddressSanitizer**: Memory error detection
- **MemorySanitizer**: Uninitialized memory detection
- **ThreadSanitizer**: Race condition detection
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing

### Dependency Management

- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot for dependency updates
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security audits
- **Pinned Versions**: Specific dependency versions in production
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce attack surface

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process
- **Signed Releases**: GPG-signed release artifacts
- **Build Isolation**: Sandboxed build environments
- **Integrity Checks**: Checksums for all artifacts
