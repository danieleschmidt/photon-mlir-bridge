# Vulnerability Management

Comprehensive vulnerability management strategy for the photon-mlir-bridge project.

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across all components of the photon-mlir-bridge project.

## Vulnerability Sources

### 1. Code Vulnerabilities
- Static analysis findings (CodeQL, Bandit, Clang Static Analyzer)
- Dynamic analysis results (Valgrind, AddressSanitizer)
- Security audits and penetration testing
- Bug bounty program findings

### 2. Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Python package vulnerabilities (PyPI packages)
- C++ library vulnerabilities (MLIR/LLVM, system libraries)
- Container base image vulnerabilities
- Build tool vulnerabilities (CMake, compilers)

### 3. Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- GitHub Actions security issues
- Container runtime vulnerabilities
- Deployment environment security issues

## Scanning Tools and Schedule

### Continuous Scanning (Every Commit)
```yaml
# GitHub Actions integration
- name: Security Scan
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
  with:
    languages: python, cpp

- name: Python Security Scan
  run: |
    bandit -r python/ -f json -o bandit-report.json
    safety check --json --output safety-report.json

- name: C++ Security Scan  
  run: |
    clang-tidy --checks='-*,cert-*,security-*' src/
    cppcheck --enable=all --xml src/ 2> cppcheck-report.xml
```

### Daily Scanning
```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
osv-scanner --sbom=photon-mlir-complete.spdx.json --format=json > osv-report.json

# Container scanning
trivy image photon-mlir:latest --format json > trivy-report.json

# Secret scanning
gitleaks detect --source . --report-format json --report-path gitleaks-report.json
```

### Weekly Deep Scanning
```bash
# Comprehensive static analysis
sonarqube-scanner \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=photon-mlir-bridge \
  -Dsonar.sources=. \
  -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io

# Dependency check with OWASP
dependency-check --project photon-mlir-bridge --scan . --format JSON
```

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Severity Classification

We use CVSS 3.1 scoring with project-specific risk factors:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution in production environments
- Authentication bypass in photonic hardware interfaces
- Data corruption in compiled photonic circuits

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)  
- Local privilege escalation
- Denial of service in compilation pipeline
- Information disclosure of proprietary algorithms

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Input validation issues
- Performance degradation vulnerabilities
- Limited information disclosure

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor configuration issues
- Non-security impacting bugs
- Theoretical attack vectors

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact | Exploitability | Risk Level | Response Time |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Critical | High | **Critical** | 24 hours |
| Critical | Medium | **High** | 72 hours |
| High | High | **High** | 72 hours |
| High | Medium | **Medium** | 2 weeks |
| Medium | High | **Medium** | 2 weeks |
| All Others | Any | **Low** | Next release |

## Response Procedures

### Critical Vulnerabilities (24-hour response)

1. **Immediate Actions** (0-2 hours)
   - Disable affected functionality if possible
   - Notify security team and maintainers
   - Create private security advisory
   - Begin impact assessment

2. **Assessment Phase** (2-8 hours)
   - Confirm vulnerability scope
   - Identify affected versions
   - Assess attack vectors and prerequisites
   - Document potential impact

3. **Remediation Phase** (8-20 hours)
   - Develop and test fix
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Coordinate with downstream users
   - Plan coordinated disclosure

4. **Release Phase** (20-24 hours)
   - Release security patch
   - Publish security advisory
   - Notify affected users
   - Update documentation

### High Vulnerabilities (72-hour response)

Similar process to critical but with extended timeframes and additional testing phases.

### Medium/Low Vulnerabilities

- Included in regular release cycle
- Documented in CHANGELOG
- Fixed during normal development process

## Automated Remediation

### Dependabot Configuration

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    reviewers:
      - "security-team"
    assignees:
      - "maintainer-team"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "security"
      include: "scope"

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

### Auto-merge Policy

Low-risk dependency updates are automatically merged if:
- All tests pass
- No breaking changes detected
- Security team approval (for security updates)
- Maintainer approval (for feature updates)

## Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability discovered/reported
2. **Day 1**: Initial triage and acknowledgment
3. **Day 7**: Detailed analysis complete
4. **Day 14**: Fix developed and tested
5. **Day 21**: Coordinated release prepared
6. **Day 30**: Public disclosure (or earlier if actively exploited)
