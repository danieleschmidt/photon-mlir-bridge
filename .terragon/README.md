# Terragon Autonomous SDLC System

This directory contains the Terragon autonomous SDLC enhancement system for the `photon-mlir-bridge` repository.

## 🎯 System Overview

The Terragon system provides **continuous value discovery and autonomous improvement execution** for software repositories. It uses advanced scoring algorithms to identify, prioritize, and execute the highest-value improvements automatically.

### Key Components

#### 1. Value Discovery Engine (`discovery-engine.py`)
- **Multi-source signal harvesting** from static analysis, security scans, performance monitoring
- **Hybrid scoring model** combining WSJF, ICE, and Technical Debt metrics
- **Intelligent prioritization** with category-specific boosts
- **Continuous learning** from execution outcomes

#### 2. Autonomous Executor (`autonomous-executor.py`)
- **Risk-assessed execution** of improvement items
- **Category-specific handlers** for different types of improvements
- **Comprehensive impact tracking** and metrics collection
- **Automated PR generation** with detailed value documentation

#### 3. Configuration System (`config.yaml`)
- **Adaptive scoring weights** based on repository maturity
- **Execution parameters** including quality gates and rollback triggers
- **Integration settings** for tools and workflows
- **Learning configuration** for continuous improvement

#### 4. Metrics Tracking (`value-metrics.json`)
- **Real-time value delivery** tracking
- **Execution history** with effort and impact analysis
- **Learning metrics** for estimation accuracy improvement
- **Repository health** and maturity progression

## 🚀 Usage

### Continuous Discovery
The system runs automatically after PR merges via git hooks:
```bash
# Discover new value opportunities
python3 .terragon/discovery-engine.py
```

### Manual Execution
Execute the next highest-value item:
```bash
# Execute improvements (dry-run)
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py --dry-run

# Execute improvements (live)
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### View Current Backlog
```bash
# View prioritized improvement backlog
cat BACKLOG.md

# View detailed scoring data
cat .terragon/discovered-backlog.json
```

## 📊 Scoring Methodology

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
```
WSJF = (User_Value + Time_Criticality + Risk_Reduction + Opportunity) / Job_Size
```

### ICE (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
```
ICE = Impact(1-10) × Confidence(1-10) × Ease(1-10)
```

### Technical Debt Scoring
```
TechDebt = (Debt_Cost + Debt_Interest) × Hotspot_Multiplier
```

### Composite Score
```
Composite = 0.6×WSJF + 0.1×ICE + 0.2×TechDebt + 0.1×Security + CategoryBoosts
```

## 🎮 Adaptive Weights

The system adapts scoring weights based on repository maturity:

| Maturity | WSJF | ICE | TechDebt | Security |
|----------|------|-----|----------|----------|
| Nascent | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
| Developing | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.1 |
| **Maturing** | **0.6** | **0.1** | **0.2** | **0.1** |
| Advanced | 0.5 | 0.1 | 0.3 | 0.1 |

## 🔄 Continuous Learning

The system continuously improves through:

### Estimation Accuracy Tracking
- Compares predicted vs actual effort
- Adjusts effort models based on historical data
- Improves confidence scoring over time

### Value Prediction Refinement  
- Tracks actual impact vs predicted impact
- Refines impact scoring algorithms
- Adapts to project-specific value patterns

### Pattern Recognition
- Identifies recurring improvement patterns
- Builds knowledge base of successful optimizations
- Accelerates similar future improvements

## 📈 Integration Points

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Triggers discovery after code changes
- Identifies new technical debt
- Updates backlog with fresh opportunities

### CI/CD Integration
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability monitoring
- Quality gate enforcement

### GitHub Actions (Planned)
- Automated PR creation for improvements
- Continuous deployment of value enhancements
- Integration with external monitoring systems

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance

### Execution Safety
- **Risk assessment** before execution
- **Dependency validation** and conflict detection
- **Rollback triggers** for failed improvements
- **Quality gates** ensuring no regressions

### Testing Integration
- Minimum 80% test coverage maintained
- No performance regressions >5%
- All builds must pass before PR creation
- Security scanning for new vulnerabilities

## 📊 Current Repository Status

```yaml
Repository: photon-mlir-bridge
Maturity Level: MATURING (65%)
Security Posture: 78/100
Technical Debt Ratio: 15%
Items in Backlog: 9
Next Best Value: Enhance secrets detection (149.7 points)
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Modify Scoring Weights
Edit `.terragon/config.yaml`:
```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    maturing:
      wsjf: 0.6        # Business value focus
      ice: 0.1         # Execution confidence
      technicalDebt: 0.2  # Maintenance reduction
      security: 0.1    # Risk mitigation
```

### Adjust Quality Gates
```yaml
execution:
  testRequirements:
    minCoverage: 80
    performanceRegression: 5
    buildSuccess: true
```

### Configure Tool Integration
```yaml
discovery:
  tools:
    staticAnalysis: [clang-tidy, mypy, flake8]
    security: [safety, gitguardian, snyk]
    performance: [benchmarks, profiler]
```

## 🤖 Autonomous Schedule

The system operates on multiple schedules:

- **Post-PR merge**: Immediate value discovery
- **Hourly**: Security vulnerability scans
- **Daily**: Comprehensive static analysis
- **Weekly**: Deep architectural analysis
- **Monthly**: Strategic value alignment review
