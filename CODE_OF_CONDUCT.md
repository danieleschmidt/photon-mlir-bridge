# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the photon-mlir-bridge community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

* Maintaining professional discourse even during technical disagreements

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

### Harassment and Discrimination
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

* Intimidation or threats toward any community member
* Encouraging or participating in exclusionary behavior
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Technical Misconduct
* Deliberately introducing malicious code or security vulnerabilities
* Misrepresenting the capabilities or performance of photonic hardware
* Plagiarizing code, algorithms, or research without proper attribution
* Sharing proprietary or confidential information without authorization
* Interfering with others' research or development work

## Community Leadership Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:
* Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
* Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate
* Take temporary or permanent action against any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

### Online Spaces
* GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions
* Project documentation and wikis
* Community forums and mailing lists
* Social media accounts associated with the project
* Online conferences, workshops, and virtual events

### Offline Spaces
* Conferences, workshops, and meetups where the project is represented
* Academic conferences presenting photon-mlir-bridge research
* Industry events showcasing photonic computing applications
* Any space where community members are representing the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the community leaders at:

**Primary Contact**: conduct@photon-mlir.dev

**Alternative Contacts**:
* Project maintainers: maintainers@photon-mlir.dev
* Individual maintainer emails (listed in MAINTAINERS.md)

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:
* Your contact information (if you're comfortable sharing it)
* Names of individuals involved (if known)
* A detailed description of the incident
* Any relevant links, screenshots, or documentation
* Whether you've reported this to any other authority
* Any other information you think would be helpful

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. Community leaders are committed to:
* Protecting the privacy of the reporter
* Keeping report details confidential
* Only sharing information on a need-to-know basis
* Providing updates to the reporter when appropriate

## Enforcement Process

### Investigation
1. **Acknowledgment**: Reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours
2. **Initial Review**: Community leaders will conduct an initial assessment

### Possible Responses

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused or sanctioned, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Contacting** the enforcement team at conduct@photon-mlir.dev
2. **Providing** additional context or information
3. **Requesting** a review of the decision
4. **Participating** in good faith in any additional investigation

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved in the original decision when possible.
