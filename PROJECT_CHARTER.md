# photon-mlir-bridge Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: photon-mlir-bridge  
**Project Lead**: Daniel Schmidt (daniel@terragon.dev)  
**Organization**: Terragon Labs  
**Charter Date**: January 2024  
**Charter Version**: 1.0

## Mission Statement

To create the world's first production-ready compiler infrastructure for silicon photonic neural network accelerators, enabling seamless deployment of machine learning models on photonic hardware with unprecedented energy efficiency and performance.

## Problem Statement

The emergence of silicon photonic computing promises to revolutionize AI inference with 10-100x energy efficiency improvements over traditional electronic accelerators. However, the lack of mature compiler toolchains prevents widespread adoption of this transformative technology.

**Current Challenges**:
- No standardized compilation pipeline from ML frameworks to photonic hardware
- Complex photonic-specific optimizations require domain expertise
- Thermal calibration and phase drift compensation require sophisticated algorithms
- Multiple incompatible photonic architectures fragment the ecosystem
- High barrier to entry for researchers and developers
